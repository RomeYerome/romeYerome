## About
I am [`Rome`](https://www.rome.io), A Full-Stack Developer with 4 years programming experience - two of those building React and Node applications. I learnt by doing - by powering through countless nights of coding courses while running an indoor-cycling studio by day. That schedule built a work ethic I still lean on for every sprint. Today, I bring together technical depth, a strategic mindset, and a voracious appetite for learning. I look forward to working with collaborative teams, and to challenges that stretch my skills and imagination.
